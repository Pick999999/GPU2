# Plan: Advanced Deriv Accumulator Strategy (Micro-Tick Enhanced)

## Objective
To develop a highly robust and safe trading strategy for Deriv Accumulators by combining macro-level market analysis (Choppiness Index & ATR) with micro-level execution precision (Micro-Tick Velocity).

## Core Philosophy
"Stability First, Speed Second." The strategy prioritizes market conditions conducive to low volatility before engaging in high-frequency execution.

## 1. Macro Market Analysis (The Filter)
**Purpose:** To identify safe trading windows where price action is stable and directional, minimizing the risk of sudden reversals or high volatility spikes.

### Indicators & Logic:
1.  **Choppiness Index (CHOP):**
    *   **Role:** Trend Strength Filter.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   Analyze on the **1-minute** or **5-minute** timeframe.
        *   **Condition:** `CHOP < 60` (Not choppy/sideways) and `CHOP > 38` (Not overly extended/volatile trend).
        *   **Action:** Only allow trading if the market is in a "Quiet Trend" state.

2.  **Average True Range (ATR):**
    *   **Role:** Volatility Gauge (Safety Valve).
    *   **Logic:**
        *   Analyze on the **1-minute** timeframe.
        *   **Condition:** `Current ATR < Simple Moving Average (ATR, 20)`.
        *   **Action:**
            *   **Green Light:** If volatility is below average.
            *   **Red Light:** If ATR spikes (indicating expanding volatility/danger), **pause trading immediately**.

3.  **Directional Bias (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   **Role:** Ensure trades align with the broader trend.
    *   **Tool:** Hull Moving Average (HMA) or EMA.
    *   **Logic:** Trade **Long** only if `Price > HMA` and `HMA Slope > 0`.

## 2. Micro-Tick Execution (The Trigger)
**Purpose:** To execute trades with precision based on real-time price tick data, bypassing the lag of traditional candle-based indicators.

### Logic (User's Proprietary "Micro-Tick"):
1.  **Velocity Monitoring:**
    *   **Measure:** The speed of price change over the last **N** ticks (e.g., 3-5 ticks).
    *   **Calculation:** `Velocity = (Tick_N - Tick_0) / Time_Elapsed`.
    *   **Condition:**
        *   **Entry:** If Velocity is **positive** and **moderate** (steady climb).
        *   **Avoid:** If Velocity is **explosive** (high risk of snapback) or **negative** (falling).

2.  **Tick Pattern Confirmation (Future Enhancement):**
    *   *Concept:* Use tick patterns to validate entry.
    *   *Pattern:* "Tick Step-Up" (Tick 1 < Tick 2 < Tick 3) indicates strong immediate momentum.

## 3. Safety Mechanisms (The Shield)
**Purpose:** To protect capital from sudden market crashes or barrier hits.

1.  **Panic Sell (Micro-Tick Based):**
    *   **Trigger:** If Micro-Tick Velocity turns **sharply negative** (e.g., drops > X points in 1 second).
    *   **Action:** **Immediate Sell** (do not wait for candle close).

2.  **Volatility Brake:**
    *   **Trigger:** If ATR suddenly expands by > 50% in a single candle.
    *   **Action:** **Hard Stop** (Cancel all pending orders, Close open positions).

## 4. Implementation Steps
1.  **Phase 1: Macro Filters**
    *   Implement CHOP and ATR calculation logic in `clsWGSLCompute.js` or main script.
    *   Visualize these indicators on the chart for verification.

2.  **Phase 2: Micro-Tick Integration**
    *   Refine the existing Micro-Tick logic to output a "Velocity Score".
    *   Connect the Velocity Score to the trade execution logic (Auto-Buy/Sell).

3.  **Phase 3: Backtesting & Tuning**
    *   Test the combined strategy (Macro Filter + Micro Trigger) on historical tick data.
    *   Tune thresholds for CHOP, ATR, and Velocity sensitivity.

## Future Ideas
*   **Dynamic Stake Sizing:** Adjust stake based on the "Confidence Level" derived from the stability of the Micro-Tick Velocity (smoother velocity = higher stake).
*   **Adaptive Barriers:** Use ATR to dynamically determine safe barrier distances (if API allows).
